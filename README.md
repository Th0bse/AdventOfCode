# My Advent of Code Solutions

This repo is for my own solution to the Advent of Code puzzles. I'm not trying
to be as fast as possible or anything, im just trying to solve the puzzles and
to have fun while doing so. (And to get better with node.js and js in general)

## Structure

Every day, there are two different puzzles to solve, so there will be one
folder for every day. The input for the puzzles will also be there, and the
link to the puzzle will be in the code.
